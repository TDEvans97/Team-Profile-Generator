  ## Description
  This application prompts a manager with a series of questions to tell us about themselves. In addition, the manager may add other employees that are engineers or interns to the team. Every team member will have a name, id, and email. Each special job role will get a different value added to its list. The results of the prompting renders to a page. This application will help managers quickly create a spreadsheet of their team roster and member information all in one place.
  ## Installation Instructions
  To install the application, clone the code into your terminal. Then install npm by entering command npm init. Inquirer will also need to be installed by entering npm install inquirer into the terminal. Finally, to begin creating a team, run node index.js in the terminal to begin answering the prompts. Upon completion, a styled index.html file is created with your customized inputs.
